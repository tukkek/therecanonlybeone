There can only be one!
==============

Scans your music collection recursively and produces a playlist with one song from each artist. This is useful if you want to create a playlist with the same chance of an artist where you hve multiple albums of being played as an artist which you have a single song of - this way bands which you happen to have plenty of songs of won't be misrepresented or dominate your shuffle playlists.

There Can Only be One is smart enough to keep a cache of your collection after the initial scan and will produce a playlist for you immediately and only after you already have your fancy shuffle playlist will it take the time to update your collection again.

This script requires the `mutagen` Python library. On Debian systems it can be installed through `apt-get install python3-mutagen`.
